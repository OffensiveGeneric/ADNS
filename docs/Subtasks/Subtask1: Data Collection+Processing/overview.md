## Subtask 1: Explainable Feature Engineering
**Objective**: Develop interpretable network traffic features that maintain detection accuracy while providing human-understandable indicators  
**Research Focus**:
- Comparative analysis of feature extraction methods (NetFlow vs. Zeek logs)
- Dimensionality reduction with explainability constraints
- Temporal feature representation
