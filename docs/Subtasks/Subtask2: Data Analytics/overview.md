## Subtask 2: Adaptive Detection Models
**Objective**: Create hybrid detection models that combine supervised classification with unsupervised anomaly detection  
**Research Focus**:
- Incremental learning architectures
- Ensemble methods for concept drift adaptation
- Explainability integration (SHAP/LIME for security contexts)
