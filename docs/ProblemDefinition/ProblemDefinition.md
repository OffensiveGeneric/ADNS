# Problem Definition and Scope

## Problem Statement
Modern networks face increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that evolve faster than traditional intrusion detection systems can adapt for. Our project aims to develop a machine learning based anomaly detection system that:
1. Identifies new attack patterns in network traffic with minimal false positives.
2. Provides explainable alerts to security analysts.
3. Adapts to new threats without complete retraining.

## Target Domain and Significance
**Application Domain**: Enterprise network security, IoT protection, and cloud infrastructure monitoring  
**Significance**:
- 83% of organizations experienced more than one data breach in 2023 (IBM Security)
- Zero day attacks increased by 150% from 2022-2024 (Palo Alto Networks Unit 42)
- Average cost of a data breach reached $4.45M in 2023 (IBM)

## Research Scope
**Included**:
- Analysis of network flow data (not full packet capture)
- Supervised and unsupervised detection methods
- Explainability features for security operations
- Benchmarking against current datasets

**Assumptions**:
- Attack patterns manifest in observable network behavior
- Sufficient training data exists for major attack categories
- False positive rate < 5% is acceptable for enterprise use
